        <p>Hi there! I'm Jenny, and I'm a lover of all things (maybe). My photo describes me perfectly, because I enjoy drinking good wine on a nice sunny day! </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> My youngest goldendoodle pup named Bella really keeps me going these days. My 13 year old Schnauzer and I are working hard as a team to train this puppy, but it doesn't seeem to be going anywhere. </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>To briefly summarize my education background, I graduated from Elmhurst College with a Vocal Performance Degree. I then pursued accounting and am now working in the accounting field. After watching my husband do his coding work at home, it really caught my attention. I hope to change my career path through this bootcamp! </p>
